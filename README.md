## Project Overview

![BornToSec Website](_assets/born_to_sec.png)

The goal is to find **14 security breaches** (flags) on a provided ISO virtual machine. For each breach, we document the exploitation process and provide the flag.

## Structure

Each vulnerability is documented in its own folder containing:
- `flag`: The capture flag.
- `Resources/`: Explanations, scripts, or files used for exploitation.

## Vulnerabilities Covered

The project covers various web vulnerabilities found in the OWASP Top 10, including:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Directory Traversal / Local File Inclusion
- Brute Force attacks
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- Broken Access Control
- and more...
